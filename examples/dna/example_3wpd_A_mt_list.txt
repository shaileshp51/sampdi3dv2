# The chains involved in protein-DNA complex are: AC
# Note here DNA is single-stranded. Still DNA mutations info takes base-pairs
# for consistency, in such case canonical base-pairs are used for both wild-type
# and mutant. For example, in case of DNA mutation (A->G), it would be (AT->GC).
# Mutating DNA chain is C the space separated fields contain following info:

C GC 10 AT

C GC 10 TA
